Learn how to launch alerts based on thresholds policies
This guide covers:

* using a Redis K/V to store some aggregations
* 

== Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you need:

* less than 15 minutes
* an IDE
* JDK 1.8+ installed with `JAVA_HOME` configured appropriately
* Apache Maven 3.5.3+
* The completed greeter application from the link:getting-started-guide[Getting Started Guide]


== Architecture

In this guide, we expand on the initial log parsing stream that was created as part of the Getting Started Guide.
We cover how to generate time window metrics on some http traffic (apache log records).


image::logisland-stream-event-aggregation.png[Archi]

== Solution

We recommend that you follow the instructions in the next sections and create the application step by step.
However, you can go right to the completed example.

Clone the Git repository: `git clone {quickstarts-clone-url}`, or download an {quickstarts-archive-url}[archive].

The solution is located in the `event-aggregation` directory.

This guide assumes you already have the completed application from the `getting-started` directory.




== Threshold based alerting on Apache logs with Redis K/V store


In a previous tutorial we saw how to use Redis K/V store as a cache storage. In this one we will practice the use of
`ComputeTag`, `CheckThresholds` and `CheckAlerts` processor in conjunction with this Redis Cache.

The following job is made of 2 streaming parts :

1. A main stream which parses Apache logs and store them to a Redis cache .
2. A timer based stream which compute some new tags values based on cached records, check some thresholds cross and send alerts if needed.

.. note::

    Be sure to know of to launch a logisland Docker environment by reading the `prerequisites <./prerequisites.html>`_ section

The full logisland job for this tutorial is already packaged in the tar.gz assembly and you can find it here :

.. code-block:: sh

    docker exec -i -t conf_logisland_1 vim conf/threshold-alerting.yml

We will start by explaining each part of the config file.

== Controller service part


The `controllerServiceConfigurations` part is here to define all services that be shared by processors within the whole job, here a Redis KV cache service that will be used later in the ``BulkPut`` processor.

[source,yaml]
----
# redis datastore service
- controllerService: datastore_service
    component: com.hurence.logisland.redis.service.RedisKeyValueCacheService
    configuration:
        connection.string: localhost:6379
        redis.mode: standalone
        database.index: 0
        communication.timeout: 10 seconds
        pool.max.total: 8
        pool.max.idle: 8
        pool.min.idle: 0
        pool.block.when.exhausted: true
        pool.max.wait.time: 10 seconds
        pool.min.evictable.idle.time: 60 seconds
        pool.time.between.eviction.runs: 30 seconds
        pool.num.tests.per.eviction.run: -1
        pool.test.on.create: false
        pool.test.on.borrow: false
        pool.test.on.return: false
        pool.test.while.idle: true
        record.recordSerializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.JsonSerializer
----

== First stream : parse logs and compute tags

Here the stream will read all the logs sent in `logisland_raw` topic and push the processing output into `logisland_events` topic as Json serialized records.

[source,yaml]
----
# a processor that converts raw apache logs into structured log records
- stream: parsing_stream
    component: com.hurence.logisland.stream.spark.KafkaRecordStreamParallelProcessing
    configuration:
        kafka.input.topics: logisland_raw
        kafka.output.topics: logisland_events
        kafka.error.topics: logisland_errors
        kafka.input.topics.serializer: none
        kafka.output.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.JsonSerializer
        kafka.error.topics.serializer: com.hurence.logisland.serializer.JsonSerializer
        kafka.metadata.broker.list: sandbox:9092
        kafka.zookeeper.quorum: sandbox:2181
        kafka.topic.autoCreate: true
        kafka.topic.default.partitions: 4
        kafka.topic.default.replicationFactor: 1
----
Within this stream a ``SplitText`` processor takes a log line as a String and computes a ``Record`` as a sequence of fields.


[source,yaml]
----
- processor: apache_parser
    component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.SplitText
    configuration:
    value.regex: (\S+)\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s+\[([\w:\/]+\s[+\-]\d{4})\]\s+"(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s*(\S*)"\s+(\S+)\s+(\S+)
    value.fields: src_ip,identd,user,record_time,http_method,http_query,http_version,http_status,bytes_out
----

This stream will process log entries as soon as they will be queued into `logisland_raw` Kafka topics, each log will
be parsed as an event which will be pushed back to Kafka in the ``logisland_events`` topic.

the next processing step is to  assign `bytes_out` field as `record_value`

[source,yaml]
----
# change field name 'bytes_out' to `record_value`
- processor: normalize_fields
    component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.NormalizeFields
    configuration:
        conflict.resolution.policy: overwrite_existing
        record_value: bytes_out
----

the we modify `record_id` to set its value as `src_ip` field.

[source,yaml]
----
# change current id to src_ip
- processor: modify_id
    component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.ModifyId
    configuration:
        id.generation.strategy: fromFields
        fields.to.hash: src_ip
        java.formatter.string: "%1$s"
----

now we'll remove all the unwanted fields

[source,yaml]
----
# remove useless fields
- processor: remove_fields
    component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.RemoveFields
    configuration:
        fields.to.remove: >
            src_ip,identd,user,http_method,http_query,
            http_version,http_status,bytes_out
----

and then cast `record_value` as a double

[source,yaml]
----
# cast values to the correct type
- processor: cast
    component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.ConvertFieldsType
    configuration:
        record_value: double
----

The next processing step wil compute a dynamic Tag value from a Javascript expression.
Here a new record with an `record_id` set to `computed1` and as a `record_value` the resulting expression of `cache("logisland.hurence.com").value * 10.2`

[source,yaml]
----
# compute tags from given formulas. each dynamic property will return 
# a new record according to the formula definition
# the record name will be set to the property name
# the record time will be set to the current timestamp
- processor: compute_tag
    component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.alerting.ComputeTags
    configuration:
        datastore.client.service: datastore_service
        output.record.type: computed_tag
        max.cpu.time: 500
        max.memory: 64800000
        max.prepared.statements: 5
        allow.no.brace: false
        computed1: return cache("logisland.hurence.com").value * 10.2;
----

The last processor will handle all the ``Records`` of this stream to index them into datastore previously defined (Redis)

[source,yaml]
----
# all the parsed records are added to datastore by bulk
- processor: datastore_publisher
    component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.datastore.BulkPut
    type: processor
    documentation: "indexes processed events in datastore"
    configuration:
    datastore.client.service: datastore_service
----




== Second stream : check threshold cross and alerting
The second stream will read all the logs sent in ``logisland_events`` topic and push the processed outputs (threshold_cross & alerts records) into ``logisland_alerts`` topic as Json serialized records.

We won't comment the stream definition as it is really straightforward.

The first processor of this stream pipeline makes use of `CheckThresholds` component which will add a new record of type `threshold_cross` with a `record_id` set to `threshold1` if the JS expression `cache("computed1").value > 2000.0` is evaluated to true.

[source,yaml]
----
- processor: compute_thresholds
    component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.alerting.CheckThresholds
    type: processor
    documentation: |
        compute threshold cross from given formulas.
        each dynamic property will return a new record according to the formula definition
        the record name will be set to the property name
        the record time will be set to the current timestamp

        a threshold_cross has the following properties : count, time, duration, value
    configuration:
        datastore.client.service: datastore_service
        output.record.type: threshold_cross
        max.cpu.time: 100
        max.memory: 12800000
        max.prepared.statements: 5
        record.ttl: 300000
        threshold1: cache("computed1").value > 2000.0
----

[source,yaml]
----
        - processor: compute_alerts1
          component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.alerting.CheckAlerts
          type: processor
          documentation: |
            compute threshold cross from given formulas.
            each dynamic property will return a new record according to the formula definition
            the record name will be set to the property name
            the record time will be set to the current timestamp
          configuration:
            datastore.client.service: datastore_service
            output.record.type: medium_alert
            alert.criticity: 1
            max.cpu.time: 100
            max.memory: 12800000
            max.prepared.statements: 5
            profile.activation.condition: cache("threshold1").value > 3000.0
            alert1: cache("threshold1").duration > 50.0
----

The last processor will handle all the ``Records`` of this stream to index them into datastore previously defined (Redis)

[source,yaml]
----
        - processor: datastore_publisher
          component: com.hurence.logisland.processor.datastore.BulkPut
          type: processor
          documentation: "indexes processed events in datastore"
          configuration:
            datastore.client.service: datastore_service
----

== Run the job
Connect a shell to your logisland container to launch the following streaming jobs.

    docker exec -i -t conf_logisland_1 bin/logisland.sh --conf conf/threshold-alerting.yml



== Inspect the logs and alerts

For this part of the tutorial we will use https://redis-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[redis-py a Python client for Redis]. You can install it by following instructions given on https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py[redis-py on github].

To install redis-py, simply:

    $ sudo pip install redis

Getting Started, check if you can connect with Redis

[source,python]
----
>>> import redis
>>> r = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
>>> r.set('foo', 'bar')
>>> r.get('foo')
----

Then we want to grab some logs that have been collected to Redis. We first find some keys with a pattern and get the json content of one

[source,python]
----
>>> r.keys('1234*')
['123493eb-93df-4e57-a1c1-4a8e844fa92c', '123457d5-8ccc-4f0f-b4ba-d70967aa48eb', '12345e06-6d72-4ce8-8254-a7cc4bab5e31']

>>> r.get('123493eb-93df-4e57-a1c1-4a8e844fa92c')
'{\n  "id" : "123493eb-93df-4e57-a1c1-4a8e844fa92c",\n  "type" : "apache_log",\n  "creationDate" : 804574829000,\n  "fields" : {\n    "src_ip" : "204.191.209.4",\n    "record_id" : "123493eb-93df-4e57-a1c1-4a8e844fa92c",\n    "http_method" : "GET",\n    "http_query" : "/images/WORLD-logosmall.gif",\n    "bytes_out" : "669",\n    "identd" : "-",\n    "http_version" : "HTTP/1.0",\n    "record_raw_value" : "204.191.209.4 - - [01/Jul/1995:01:00:29 -0400] \\"GET /images/WORLD-logosmall.gif HTTP/1.0\\" 200 669",\n    "http_status" : "200",\n    "record_time" : 804574829000,\n    "user" : "-",\n    "record_type" : "apache_log"\n  }\n}'

>>> import json
>>> record = json.loads(r.get('123493eb-93df-4e57-a1c1-4a8e844fa92c'))
>>> record['fields']['bytes_out']
